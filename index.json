Here, we construct a Comprehensive Mouse Gut Metagenome (CMGM) catalog by assembling all currently available mouse gut metagenomes and combining them with published reference and metagenome-assembled genomes. The 50'011 genomes cluster into 1'699 species, of which 78.1% are uncultured, and we discovered 226 new genera, 7 new families, and 1 new order. Rarefaction analysis indicates comprehensive sampling of the species from the mouse gut. CMGM enables an unprecedented coverage of the mouse gut microbiome exceeding 90%. Comparing CMGM to the human gut microbiota shows an overlap 64% at the genus, but only 16% at the species level, demonstrating that human and mouse gut microbiota are largely distinct.","tags":["Metagenome-assembled genomes","Genome-resolved metagenomics","Metagenomics","Binning","metagenome-atlas","Virus"],"title":"Comprehensive mouse gut metagenome catalogue reveals major difference to the human counterpart","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chevalier Claire","Silas Kieser","Melis Çolakoğlu","Noushin Hadadi","Julia Brun","Dorothée Rigo","Nicolas Suárez-Zamorano","Martina Spiljar","Salvatore Fabbiano","Björn Busse","Julijana Ivanišević","Andrew Macpherson","Nicolas Bonnet","Mirko Trajkovski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601942400,"objectID":"0f7c1e92bf4f44dc09bbd68a76e4a7b1","permalink":"/publication/warm/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/warm/","section":"publication","summary":"Warmth exposure (34°C) protects against ovariectomy-induced bone loss in adult female, as well as in young male mice.

Recent improvements in sequence assembly methods have eased the reliance on genome databases, thereby allowing the recovery of genomes from uncultured microbes. However, configuring these tools, linking them with advanced binning and annotation tools, and maintaining provenance of the processing continues to be challenging for researchers. Here we present ATLAS, a software package for customizable data processing from raw sequence reads to functional and taxonomic annotations using state-of-the-art tools to assemble, annotate, quantify, and bin metagenome data. Abundance estimates at genome resolution are provided for each sample in a dataset. ATLAS is written in Python and the workflow implemented in Snakemake; it operates in a Linux environment, and is compatible with Python 3.5+ and Anaconda 3+ versions. The source code for ATLAS is freely available, distributed under a BSD-3 license. ATLAS provides a user-friendly, modular and customizable Snakemake workflow for metagenome data processing; it is easily installable with conda and maintained as open-source on GitHub at https://github.com/metagenome-atlas/atlas.","tags":["Snakemake","Bioinformatics","Genome-resolved metagenomics","Metagenomics","Binning","metagenome-atlas"],"title":"ATLAS: a Snakemake workflow for assembly, annotation, and genomic binning of metagenome sequence data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silas Kieser","Shafiqul A.

Compared with 20 healthy local controls, 71 Bangladeshi children hospitalized with acute diarrhoea (AD) of viral, mixed viral/bacterial, bacterial and unknown aetiology showed a significantly decreased bacterial diversity with loss of pathways characteristic for the healthy distal colon microbiome (mannan degradation, methylerythritol phosphate and thiamin biosynthesis), an increased proportion of faecal streptococci belonging to the Streptococcus bovis and Streptococcus salivarius species complexes, and an increased level of E. coli-associated virulence genes. No enteropathogens could be attributed to a subgroup of patients. Elevated lytic coliphage DNA was detected in 2 out of 5 investigated enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC)-infected patients. Streptococcal outgrowth in AD is discussed as a potential nutrient-driven consequence of glucose provided with oral rehydration solution.","tags":["human gut microbiota","metagenomics","Nestlé","phages"],"title":"Bangladeshi children with acute diarrhoea show faecal microbiomes with increased Streptococcus abundance, irrespective of diarrhoea aetiology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silas Kieser","Shafiqul A.

The role of the gut microbiome in malnutrition is an active research area.
