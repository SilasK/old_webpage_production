To fill this gap, we studied the stool microbiota in 19 SAM patients from Bangladesh hospitalized with acute diarrhea (AD) and compared it with that of matched 20 healthy control subjects (HC).","tags":["human gut microbiota","metagenomics","Nestlé","phages"],"title":"Antibiotic Treatment Leads to Fecal Escherichia coli and Coliphage Expansion in Severely Malnourished Diarrhea Patients","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483315200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578252704,"objectID":"c48e4d9a6d22d93edd8428a4fad58f99","permalink":"https://silask.github.io/project/apologetics/","publishdate":"2017-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/apologetics/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["apologetics"],"title":"Apologetics","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Nestlé Research Center Feb 2016 – Feb 2017\nThis Internship allowed me to learn from experts about children gut microbiota.
