Here, we construct a Comprehensive Mouse Gut Metagenome (CMGM) catalog by assembling all currently available mouse gut metagenomes and combining them with published reference and metagenome-assembled genomes. The 50'011 genomes cluster into 1'699 species, of which 78.1% are uncultured, and we discovered 226 new genera, 7 new families, and 1 new order. Rarefaction analysis indicates comprehensive sampling of the species from the mouse gut. CMGM enables an unprecedented coverage of the mouse gut microbiome exceeding 90%. Comparing CMGM to the human gut microbiota shows an overlap 64% at the genus, but only 16% at the species level, demonstrating that human and mouse gut microbiota are largely distinct.","tags":["Metagenome-assembled genomes","Genome-resolved metagenomics","Metagenomics","Binning","metagenome-atlas","Virus"],"title":"Comprehensive mouse gut metagenome catalogue reveals major difference to the human counterpart","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chevalier Claire","Silas Kieser","Melis Çolakoğlu","Noushin Hadadi","Julia Brun","Dorothée Rigo","Nicolas Suárez-Zamorano","Martina Spiljar","Salvatore Fabbiano","Björn Busse","Julijana Ivanišević","Andrew Macpherson","Nicolas Bonnet","Mirko Trajkovski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601942400,"objectID":"0f7c1e92bf4f44dc09bbd68a76e4a7b1","permalink":"/publication/warm/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/warm/","section":"publication","summary":"Warmth exposure (34°C) protects against ovariectomy-induced bone loss in adult female, as well as in young male mice.

Recent improvements in sequence assembly methods have eased the reliance on genome databases, thereby allowing the recovery of genomes from uncultured microbes. However, configuring these tools, linking them with advanced binning and annotation tools, and maintaining provenance of the processing continues to be challenging for researchers. Here we present ATLAS, a software package for customizable data processing from raw sequence reads to functional and taxonomic annotations using state-of-the-art tools to assemble, annotate, quantify, and bin metagenome data. Abundance estimates at genome resolution are provided for each sample in a dataset. ATLAS is written in Python and the workflow implemented in Snakemake; it operates in a Linux environment, and is compatible with Python 3.5+ and Anaconda 3+ versions. The source code for ATLAS is freely available, distributed under a BSD-3 license. ATLAS provides a user-friendly, modular and customizable Snakemake workflow for metagenome data processing; it is easily installable with conda and maintained as open-source on GitHub at https://github.com/metagenome-atlas/atlas.","tags":["Snakemake","Bioinformatics","Genome-resolved metagenomics","Metagenomics","Binning","metagenome-atlas"],"title":"ATLAS: a Snakemake workflow for assembly, annotation, and genomic binning of metagenome sequence data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

The role of the gut microbiome in malnutrition is an active research area.
