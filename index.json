Recent improvements in algorithms enabled the assembly of larger and larger contigs from metagenomes, which then can be clustered together to produce draft genomes of new species. In this way, an almost unimaginable number of genomes from uncultured microbes could be assembled. These genomes allow for dataset-specific taxonomic analysis and genome-resolved functional annotation of metagenomes.\nIn this online course, we will familiarize the participants with the steps required in assembly-based metagenomics (assembly, binning, genome completeness estimation, taxonomic and functional annotation). In the hand-on session we will use metagenome-atlas, a pipeline that implements the commonly used tools in a single workflow allowing users to get started with only three commands. Finally, we will show how to use the output of metagenome-atlas to answer scientific questions. The course will also serve as a platform for interaction between researchers and students, working with metagenome and metatranscriptome data.\nSlides  From reads to genomes Atlas in details  For background reading have a look at my PhD thesis.\n Silas Kieser  12.

Here, we construct a Comprehensive Mouse Gut Metagenome (CMGM) catalog by assembling all currently available mouse gut metagenomes and combining them with published reference and metagenome-assembled genomes. The 50'011 genomes cluster into 1'699 species, of which 78.1% are uncultured, and we discovered 226 new genera, 7 new families, and 1 new order. Rarefaction analysis indicates comprehensive sampling of the species from the mouse gut. CMGM enables an unprecedented coverage of the mouse gut microbiome exceeding 90%. Comparing CMGM to the human gut microbiota shows an overlap 64% at the genus, but only 16% at the species level, demonstrating that human and mouse gut microbiota are largely distinct.","tags":["Metagenome-assembled genomes","Genome-resolved metagenomics","Metagenomics","Binning","metagenome-atlas","Virus"],"title":"Comprehensive mouse gut metagenome catalogue reveals major difference to the human counterpart","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chevalier Claire","Silas Kieser","Melis √áolakoƒülu","Noushin Hadadi","Julia Brun","Doroth√©e Rigo","Nicolas Su√°rez-Zamorano","Martina Spiljar","Salvatore Fabbiano","Bj√∂rn Busse","Julijana Ivani≈°eviƒá","Andrew Macpherson","Nicolas Bonnet","Mirko Trajkovski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601942400,"objectID":"0f7c1e92bf4f44dc09bbd68a76e4a7b1","permalink":"https://silask.github.io/publication/warm/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/warm/","section":"publication","summary":"Warmth exposure (34¬∞C) protects against ovariectomy-induced bone loss in adult female, as well as in young male mice.

Recent improvements in sequence assembly methods have eased the reliance on genome databases, thereby allowing the recovery of genomes from uncultured microbes. However, configuring these tools, linking them with advanced binning and annotation tools, and maintaining provenance of the processing continues to be challenging for researchers. Here we present ATLAS, a software package for customizable data processing from raw sequence reads to functional and taxonomic annotations using state-of-the-art tools to assemble, annotate, quantify, and bin metagenome data. Abundance estimates at genome resolution are provided for each sample in a dataset. ATLAS is written in Python and the workflow implemented in Snakemake; it operates in a Linux environment, and is compatible with Python 3.5+ and Anaconda 3+ versions. The source code for ATLAS is freely available, distributed under a BSD-3 license. ATLAS provides a user-friendly, modular and customizable Snakemake workflow for metagenome data processing; it is easily installable with conda and maintained as open-source on GitHub at https://github.com/metagenome-atlas/atlas.","tags":["Snakemake","Bioinformatics","Genome-resolved metagenomics","Metagenomics","Binning","metagenome-atlas"],"title":"ATLAS: a Snakemake workflow for assembly, annotation, and genomic binning of metagenome sequence data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Silas Kieser","Shafiqul A.

No enteropathogens could be attributed to a subgroup of patients. Elevated lytic coliphage DNA was detected in 2 out of 5 investigated enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC)-infected patients.
