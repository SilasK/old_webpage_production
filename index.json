When I learned how complicated it was to sequence and the first human genome, I found metagenomics, the idea of sequencing thousand of microbial genomes at once mind-boggling. I\u0026rsquo;m happy to be part of this endeavor to resolve these enormous puzzles and recover genomes from complicated metagenomes. I\u0026rsquo;m the lead developer of the tool called metagenome-atlas that has the goal to make genome-resolved metagenomics easy and to allow to start in three commands. I\u0026rsquo;m finishing my PhD at the University of Geneva in the lab of Prof. Mirko Trajkovski, co-supervised by Prof. Evgeny Zdobnov. Besides microbiome analysis at the computer, I\u0026rsquo;m also hands-on involved by changing the diapers of my two children.
